#Stats 
A **Goodness-of-fit** test is used to give a degree of compatibility  between the observed data and the [[Null Hypothesis]]. 

The significance of a difference can be evaluated with the [[P-Value]]

The [[P-Value]] gives a measure of how often one expects to see data as compatible or less if the experiment is repeated under similar circumstances. This leads to some issues of what counts as similar circumstances, leading to the [[Optional Stopping Problem]].
