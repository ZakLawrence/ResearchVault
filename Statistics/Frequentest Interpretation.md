In the frequentest approach probabilities are interpreted as a limiting case of the **relative frequency** that a given outcome is observed compared to the total number of observations. 
$$P(A) = \lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty} \frac{N_A}{n}$$
where $N_A$ is the number of times that the event $A$ is observed.

Since this is a limiting case the probabilities can only ever be **estimated** and are not **perfectly determined**. Therefore the work of statistics is to estimate these probabilities given some ammount of data.  
This interpretation can also be used when considering how compatible a model that predicts the probabilities is whith the observations. 

One issue with the frequentist approach is that if a process in not repetable. In this case we can only imagine a set of similar scenarios and ask how often we would expect to see a given outcome.
