The [[Critical region]] of a test is not defined a priori, we must make a choice of how to define it.
The **acceptance region** is defined to give the highest [[Power]] for a given [[Significance level]] 
$$\frac{g(t|H_0)}{g(t|H_1)} > C$$

Where $C$ is a constant that is determined by the desiered efficiency. This ratio is ofter reffered to as the [[Likelihood Ratio]]

If a region has a high [[Power]] then it will have a high [[Signal Purity]], while the [[Significance level]] is related to the [[Selection Efficiency]]
