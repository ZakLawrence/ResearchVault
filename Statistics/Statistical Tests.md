A statistical test is used to make statements on how well a observations agrees with a given [[Hypothesis]] 

This could be comparing a [[Null Hypothesis]] against an alternate hypothesis. In this case we are interested in the [[Probability density function]] given by $f(\vec{x}|H_0)$ and $f(\vec{x}|H_1)$ which is the [[Conditional Probability]] to observe some data, $\vec{x}$ given a hypothesis $H_0$ or $H_1$.

A [[Test statistic]], $t(\vec{x})$ is constructed to discriminate between the hypotheses. This gives $g(t|H_0)$ and $g(t|H_1)$.

Important to a test statistic are the [[Critical region]], [[Significance level]] and [[Power]]

The relation between them is illustrated bellow

When considering a statistical tests there are two types of error that can occur, [[Errors of The First Kind]] or [[Errors of The Second Kind]]

When performing a statistical test we must make a  [[Choice of The Critical Region]]
