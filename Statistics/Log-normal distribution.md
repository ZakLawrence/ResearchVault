The **Log-normal distribution** is given by 
$$f(x;\mu,\sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\frac{1}{x} \exp \bigg(\frac{-(\log{x}-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\bigg)$$

The Log-normal distribution is followed for any random variable $x$ that is given by $x=e^y$ where $y$ follows a [[Gaussian distribution]]. The [[Expectation Value]] and [[Variance]] is given by 
$$<x> = \exp(\mu+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)$$
$$<(x-<x>)^2> = \exp(2\mu+\sigma^2)[\exp(\sigma^2)-1]$$

Given the [[Central Limit Theorem]] gives a [[Gaussian distribution]] if the function is the sum of random variable. This also implies that if the random variable is the product of many random variables the it will follow a Log-normal distribution.
