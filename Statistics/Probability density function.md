The probability density function $f(x)dx$ is **the probability of $X$ being observed in the range $[x,x+\Delta x]$**

The probability to observe the random variabe in the interval $[a,b]$ is 
$$P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int\limits_a^b f(x)dx$$
where the probability density function is normalised so that 
$$\int\limits_{\Omega}f(x)dx = 1$$

[[Discrete random variables]] are a special case of [[Continuous random variables]] with a probaility density function 
$$f(x) = \sum\limits_i P_i \delta(x-x_i)$$
