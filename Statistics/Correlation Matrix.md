#### Definition Stats 
A **confusion matrix** or **correlation matrix** is a table showing the [[Correlation]] coefficients between multiple variables. Each cell in the matrix represents the correlation (typically using Pearson’s correlation coefficient) between two variables. The values range from -1 to 1:

- **+1** indicates a perfect positive correlation (as one variable increases, the other increases).
- **-1** indicates a perfect negative correlation (as one variable increases, the other decreases).
- **0** indicates no linear correlation between the variables.

The matrix is symmetric, with ones along the diagonal (since a variable is perfectly correlated with itself). It’s often used in statistics and data analysis to understand relationships between multiple variables.
