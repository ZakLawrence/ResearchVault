1. For all events in the sample space the probability must be greater than zero, $\forall A \in \Omega \Rightarrow P(A) \geq 0$ 
2. For two events, $A$ & $B$ in the sample space if they are **disjoint** ($A \cap B = \emptyset$) then the probability for the total region must be $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$
3. The overall probability for all event in the sample space must be one. $$P(\Omega) = \sum\limits_{\omega \in \Omega} P(\omega) = 1$$
