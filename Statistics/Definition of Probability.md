Defining probability mathematically requires the following concepts 

**Sample Space** ⇒ The sample space, $\Omega$ , of an experiment is the set of outcomes that can be obtained by the experiment

**Event**  ⇒ An event, $A$, forms a subset of $\Omega$, so $A \subset \Omega$

**Elementary event** ⇒ This is a single element of $\Omega$
