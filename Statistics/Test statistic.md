A **test statistic** is any function constructed from data ($\vec{x}$), it can even be a multidimensional vector $\vec{t} =(t_1,\cdots,t_n)$ or simply the observed data itself. It is used to determine between competing [[Hypothesis]]. 

Having a test statistic with lower dimension than the data allows for a reduction in the amount of data without loosing the ability to discriminate between hypotheses.
