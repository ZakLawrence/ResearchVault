The cumulative distribution is the probability that a random variable takes a value up to a given value of $X$
$$F_X(x) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{X} f(x')dx' $$
The  **cumulative distribution $F_{X}(x)$ characterises the random variable $X$ uniquely** and can be used to give the function $f(x)$
$$f(x) = \frac{d}{dx}F_X(x)$$
The quantile of order $\alpha$ is defined as $F_X(x_{\alpha}) = \alpha$. The **median** is the special case of $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$
