#### Relational Databases
A relational database stores information in tables that will contain information that is organised in columns and rows. A column represents a single attribute while a row represents an single entry. 
The *primary key* is used to uniquely identify a given row in the table.  This is useful in cases where some rows contain identical bits of information. 
A *foreign key* is used to link a table to another. It will act as a *primary key* in another table. It is possible to define multiple foreign keys within a single table.
